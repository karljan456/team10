Javascript Ideas
Results Table should be color coded.
When percentage is less than 33.33% it shows red, 33.34 - 66.67% it shows yellow and above 66.68 it shows green.

Buttons should expand a bit onHover()

Buttons should be color coded to show what was pressed last.
eg. Red for Delete, Orange for Edit and Green for Submit.
Design buttons to look appealing. Rounded edges.
