Poll-Site Feature

Users can peredict the outcomes of certain matches and seasons, etc.

You would need to be a registered member to gain access to vote in the poll.

Ideally, the results can later be displayed on the site page as a collective.
Maybe in a chart form. (wordpress).

Can implement a Timestamp to separate the voting times later and display the data
based on the day or month of the vote.
