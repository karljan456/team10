I will try to use PHP crud to create the following features to our website:
1) user pages:
    a) user login page
    b) user signup page with solid validation
    c) user profile page

2) Admin pages:
    a) Simple admin dashboard
    b) users page (edit, delete and create)
    c) Posts page (edit, delete and create)
    d)

3) Other features:
    a) Website Light/Dark mode (using PHP cookie session and a simple js function).
    b)
